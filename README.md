# Emotional Arousal in News Headlines as a Predictor of Stock Market Behavior

Explored the impact of emotionally charged news headlines on short-term stock market behavior using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Applied emotion and sentiment classification models (fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa and DistilBERT), conducted feature engineering, and trained a regression model to predict 3-day stock returns. Completed as part of the AI4ALL Ignite accelerator, with a focus on responsible AI and data-driven insight into market psychology.


## Problem Statement

As emotionally charged headlines become increasingly prevalent in modern news media, understanding their influence on investor behavior grows ever more critical. Given that financial decisions are often guided by current events, the emotional tone of news may play a powerful role in shaping market trends.

## Key Results 

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.

*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*


## Methodologies 

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
